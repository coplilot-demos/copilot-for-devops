name: Build and Deploy (GitHub Pages - artifact deploy)

# Use the modern Pages deployment flow:
# 1) Build the site and upload the static files as a Pages artifact (upload-pages-artifact)
# 2) Deploy the uploaded artifact with actions/deploy-pages (no gh-pages branch required)

on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]

# Grant only the permissions required for Pages deployment
permissions:
    contents: read # not writing repo contents
    pages: write # allow deployment to Pages
    id-token: write # required by deploy-pages action for authentication
